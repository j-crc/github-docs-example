# Writing good documentation

## Step 1 - Using codeblocks
Codeblocks in markdown make it very easy for tech people to *copy, paste, and share code* because it allows otehr to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues.

- A good Cloud Engineer uses codeblocks whenever possible. When you can, you should attempt to apply syntax highlighting to your codeblocks, like this:

```ruby
def factorial(n)
  if n == 0
    return 1
  else
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
  end
end

# Calculate the factorial of 5
result = factorial(5)
puts "Factorial of 5 is #{result}"
```


- Make note of where the backtick button is located on your keyboard (it varies depending on your kb layout/region).

- Good Cloud Engineers use codeblocks for both code and code errors that appear on the console. Here is an example of using codeblocks for an error that appears in bash.


```bash
$ nonExistentCommand
bash: nonExistentCommand: command not found
```

## Step 2 - How to take screenshots

A screenshot is when you capture a part of your screen from your laptop, desktop or phone. This is not to be confused with taking a photo with your phone.

I suggest using Lighshot [<sup>[1]</sup>](#references), it works on Windows and Mac. With this tool, you can capture the screen or part of it and save it as an image or paste it on Paint.



## Step 3 - Using Github Flavored Task lists

Github extends markdown to have a list where you can check off items.[<sup>[2]</sup>](#references)

## Step 4 - Using Emojis

Github Flavored Markdown supports emoji shortcodes. Here are some examples:

| Name       | Shortcode   | Emoji |
|------------|------------ |-------|
| Smile      |   `:smile:`   |  üòä   |
| Heart      |   `:heart:`   |  ‚ù§Ô∏è   |
| Thumbs Up  |   `:+1:`      |  üëç  |
| Coffee     |   `:coffee:`  |  ‚òï  |
| Cloud     |   `:cloud:`  |  ‚òÅÔ∏è  |
